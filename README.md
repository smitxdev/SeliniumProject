How to Run the Code
Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can check this by running:

bash
Copy code
python --version
or

bash
Copy code
python3 --version
Create a virtual environment using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv vs
(Replace python3 with python if your system uses it as the default.)

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
vs\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source vs/bin/activate
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the application by running:

bash
Copy code
python3 app.py
(Again, replace python3 with python if necessary.)
